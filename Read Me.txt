This list of programs have specific purpose. Program and what they are for is listed below:

(I) M_RDTD45




M_RDTD: This program calculates taylor factors (M). 

As input it asks for either of the: 

1) Ideal texture component i.e. {hkl}<uvw>
2) Orientation file from the bulk texture measurement. This file should be a .txt file with euler angles listed in columns.
3) External strain tensor.

As output it gives taylor factor values in RD, TD and 45 to RD direction tensile tests.



(II) M_theta



M_theta: This program plots M variation with the orientation of the tensile axis from RD.

As input it asks for:

1) Ideal texture component i.e. {hkl}<uvw>
2) orientation file from the bulk texture measurement. This file should be a .txt file with euler angles listed in columns.
3) External strain tensor.

As output it plots taylor factor values against the angle between tensile direction and the RD.


(III)  M_ro



M_ro: This program plots M variation with ro, Where ro=-e_w/e_l 

As input it asks for:

1) Ideal texture component i.e. {hkl}<uvw>
2) orientation file from the bulk texture measurement. This file should be a .txt file with euler angles listed in columns.

As output:

1) It plots taylor factor values against ro values.
2) This it does for uniaxial loading along RD, TD and 45 to RD.
3) It also gives r values for the three directions.
4) It also calculates r bar value.  


(IV) ITC2euler



ITCtoeuler: This program calculates euler angles phi1, phi, phi2 for the given ideal texture component {hkl}<uvw>

Input: ideal texture component {hkl}<uvw> as string 'h k l u v w'

output: euler angles phi1, phi, phi2


(V) e_xtal_miller


e_xtal_miller: This program transforms the external strain to the crystal reference frame.

Input: This program asks for the external strain as input.It aslo asks the crystal orientation with respect to the external reference frame in hkl uvw format.

Output: This program gives out the strain tensor in the crystal reference frame. 


(VI) N_xtal

N_xtal: This program calculates the precipitate strengthening factor in the RD, TD and 45 to RD direction for a crystal.

Input: As input it asks for the external strain tensor and the orientation of the crystal in the sample reference frame.

Output: It gives out Nbar values for RD, TD and 45 from RD directions.


(VII) N_bar

N_bar: This program calculates the average N value for the bulk material.

Input: It asks for external strain tensor and the orientation file from the bulk texture measurement. This file should be a .txt file with euler angles listed in columns.

Output:O It gives out Nbar values for RD, TD and 45 from RD directions.


(VIII) e_xtal_euler

e_xtal_euler: This program calculates the strain tensor in crystal reference frame.

Input: This program askes for external strain condition. It also asks for the text file containing orientation of the crystal in the euler angle format.

Output: The strain tensor in the crystal reference frame is given out in matrix form on the matlab prompt screen.The strain tensor is calculated for the three choices of the x axis of the external strain: RD, TD and 45 from RD. 

(IX) yield_locus

yield_locus: This program draws the yield locus for a orientation data file

(X) yield_locus_allstates 

yield_locus_allstates: It plots all the BH stress states on the sigmax and sigmay space
